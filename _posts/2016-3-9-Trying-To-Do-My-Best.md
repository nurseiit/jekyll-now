<h3><i>Hi there!</i></h3>

It’s been a long time since I last wrote here (2 months). 
But one can ask where did my first post go: it disappeared… Just kidding: I deleted it for some reasons. 
To be exact: some time ago my Internet provider or the whole country decided to block <i>WordPress.com</i>, 
so I deleted my site (or I thought so), anyway now I am here with this blog post.

So… You may think why my posts are in English, why it is not Kazakhsha or in Russian? Answer is simple: I am simply trying to improve my English writing skills. It means after some time I may continue posting in Kazakh or Russian.

What I’m gonna say now is about me in competitive programming, further just <strong>CP</strong>.

On 6th (or not) January was Regional (3rd) Stage of Republic Olympiads. 
And I have some strange feelings about it, despite the fact that I have won the first place :\. 
There were mostly straightforward (easy) problems, but I managed to fail the first day. 
Took only <strong>136 points out of 300</strong>, and ranked 2nd after Bagdat (he had <strong>140</strong> pts). 
And it is not the only reason why I felt so frustrated: 
at first my points were only <strong>6</strong>, yes <strong>Only 6 out of 300</strong>. 
And it was fault of jouries committee, so it wasn’t too hard to fix it. 
So the main reason of why I took so small amount of points are:

<ol>
<li>Organization wasn’t good (we’ve been waiting for problem statements about 2 hours)</li>
<li>And it was my fault not checking for correctness by stress testing (don’t worry it is <strong>CP</strong> termin)</li>
<li>I was very tired</li>
</ol>

So I decided to not to repeat this mistakes on second day. And here it comes the second day: 
was a bit harder than first, and ended up with <strong>240 points out of 300</strong>. With overall results I got First place.

<i>You know, it’s very strange that only 4-5 person from the whole South 
Kazakhstan Region took higher than 20 points in 1st day: it shows  How LOW the level of CP in our region…</i> 

And a bonus: photo from International Woman’s Day concert.
